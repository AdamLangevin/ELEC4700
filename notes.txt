- The exam will test the approach that we take to tackle problems
- MD - calculate potential between two forces
- MC - calculating average of the probability of the representative process
  |- look at PA 3, might be useful
- FD/Harmincs - look at the equation, make sure to know how to get mesh eqns
- SCE/TI - solve down to eigin value problem
- Transport - charge change equations/Jn/Jp, FD solutions
- YEE Cell - know how to build it, where the E vec is described by the curl of the mag eqns
  |- Propegation in 3D --> develops eigin value problem
- MNA - use FD for Cap values. 
- Compact models - looking at how to build SPICE models, looking more for how to make it rather than what it is
- know eqns: diffusion/wave/MNA/IV

- compact models - nonlinear needs jacobian, and use newton-rpahson 
- MD fundamental parameter - Lenard jones funct
- MC  "  " - probaility
